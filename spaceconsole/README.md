The CPU-intensive text editor of choice for dramatic and/or space-themed writing.

Features:
* Scroll up or down to change the speed of the starfield.
* Bold or italicize text with ```ctrl-b``` and ```ctrl-i```.
* There are no other features.

Planned features:
* Use of Sanitize.js to ensure that only plaintext can be pasted into the contenteditable div,
  instead of messy HTML. Currently, pasting in anything other than plaintext looks odd.  
* Use of the jQuery terminal emulator http://terminal.jcubic.pl/
* Dropbox saving/syncing
